This project was used for MATH 4390 Math Project as a graduation requirement. 

## Summary:
In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to shape global health, society, and research efforts. The SIRV (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Vaccinated) model became a crucial tool for understanding and predicting the dynamics of the virus's spread. This year marked a significant phase in the pandemic response, characterized by widespread vaccination campaigns and evolving viral variants.
Furthermore, the project investigates the sensitivity of the model to changes in parameters, such as transmission rates, recovery rates, and vaccination rates. Sensitivity analysis helps in understanding the robustness of the model and identifying critical factors influencing the disease dynamics and the efficacy of vaccination.
The findings of this study provide insights into the potential impact of vaccination on controlling and preventing the spread of infectious diseases within a population. The integration of vaccination into the SIR model offers a valuable framework for policymakers and public health officials to evaluate and implement effective vaccination strategies, thereby aiding in the containment and management of epidemics.
Ultimately, this research contributes to the understanding of how vaccination, when integrated into a differential equation-based SIR model, can serve as a powerful tool in disease control and public health planning, particularly in the context of emerging infectious diseases and the optimization of vaccination campaigns.
